In todayâ€™s remote-first work culture, **online collaboration tools** have become essential for keeping teams aligned across continents. Whether you're managing tasks, holding virtual meetings, or sharing files in real-time, platforms like Slack, Zoom, and Trello empower global teams to work efficiently from anywhere.

But remote access also introduces new risksâ€”**data breaches, unsecured Wi-Fi, and compromised communications** are real threats for distributed teams.

Thatâ€™s why using a [**proxy**](https://the9proxy.short.gy/home-github-james2k4) is critical for protecting your digital workspace.
